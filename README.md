# 🐍 OpenCV Snake Game

This is a fun and interactive **Snake Game** that uses **real-time hand tracking** with your webcam.

## 🎮 How It Works

* The webcam captures your hand movement.
* Your **index finger** controls the snake's head.
* The snake grows as it eats food (a donut image).
* If the snake **collides with itself**, the game ends.
* Press **'R'** to restart the game after a game over.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenCV
* cvzone
* NumPy
* Webcam for real-time tracking

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* OpenCV
* cvzone
* NumPy 
* Webcam

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the code.
2. Make sure the image file `Donut.png` is present in the same directory as the script.
3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

5. Use your index finger in front of the webcam to play!

## 🎯 Game Rules

* Move your index finger to guide the snake.
* Eat food to grow the snake and increase your score.
* Avoid colliding with your own body — this ends the game.
* You can press **R** to restart if the game is over.
